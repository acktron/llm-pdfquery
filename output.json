They had played all day but now that\nit was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do.\nThey couldn\u2019t play soccer because they couldn\u2019t see the\nball. They didn\u2019t want to go inside and play a game because\nit was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being\noutside, especially after having to play inside all winter\nlong. They just didn\u2019t know what to do and it was a little\ntoo early for them to go home.\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just go home,\u201d Mark said in a sad voice. \u201cAww\ncome on,\u201d replied James. \u201cWe still have time for another\ngame of \u2013 of something.\u201d\nThen Sally said, \u201cI have an idea! Let\u2019s play Hide-and Seek.\u201d\u201cI was just going to say that,\u201d James said. \u201cYah, I\u2019ll bet,\u201d\nreplied his sister. \u201cYou always say you were thinking of\nwhatever I think of,\u201d she snapped. \u201cDo not!\u201d James said in\na loud voice. \u201cDo too,\u201d yelled Sally.\nMark just looked down at the ground and shook his head\nfrom side to side. \u201cThey are at it again,\u201d he mumbled to\nhimself. Then he yelled, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s play Hide-and-Seek\nI\u2019ll be the seeker!\u201d\nHe turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started\ncounting out loud. \u201c100 \u2013 99 \u2013 98 \u2013 97 \u2026..\u201d Sally and Mark\nstopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in\ndifferent directions to find a hiding place.\nIn the distance they could still hear Mark counting\n\u201c4 \u2013 3 \u2013 2 \u2013 1. Ready or not, here\nI come!\u201d Then he turned and began looking for places\nwhere they could be hiding.Finding Sally was easy.\nShe always ran off and then circled back\nso she would be close to \u201cbase,\u201d\nthe safe place to get to before being tagged.\nMark looked for the biggest tree\nand ran towards it.\nBut she wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s behind that big bush,\u201d\nhe said to himself.\nSo he ran to it and was ready to tag her,\nbut she wasn\u2019t there either.As he turned around, he saw James running towards\n\u201cbase\u201d and darted after him. Just before\nhe touched James\u2019 shoulder, James tagged the \u201cbase\u201d\nand yelled out \u201cSAFE!\u201d \u201cDid you get Sally yet?\u201d\nJames asked. \u201cNo,\u201d said Mark.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find her and it\u2019s getting late and\nwe need to be heading home.\u201dSo both boys yelled out\n\u201cCome on out Sally, it\u2019s late.\u201d\nBut there was no reply.\nNot even a little snicker from\nsomewhere in the darkness.\nThey yelled again.\n\u201cCome on out Sally, it\u2019s late.\u201d\nStill there was no reply from Sally.\nThey began to worry and started searching for her. As\nthey walked around the area they called out \u201cSally, come\non, we give up; you\u2019re safe.\u201d\nBut no matter where they looked,\nor how much they called out,\nSally didn\u2019t answer.\nIt was as if she disappeared.Sally was wondering what had happened.\nAll she could remember was\ncrawling under the big trunk\nof a fallen tree to hide.\nNow, as she looked up, she saw\nseveral stars through a small hole above her head.\nShe had fallen into a hole\nwhen she crawled under the tree trunk.\n\u201cHelp!\u201d she yelled and heard her voice\necho throughout what must have been a cave.\n\u201cHELP! Help, help, help!\u201d\u201cDid you hear that, James?\u201d\nMark said excitedly.\n\u201cSally just yelled for help.\u201d\n\u201cKeep yelling Sally,\u201d James screamed.\n\u201cThat way we can find you.\u201d\nSally heard her brother and\nkept screaming. After a short while the boys were\nstanding next to the big tree trunk.\n\u201cHey! Are you stuck under this tree?\u201d\nasked James. \u201cKind of,\u201d Sally yelled.\n\u201cWhen I crawled under\nit to hide, I fell into a cave.\nPlease help me, I\u2019m scared.\nIt\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t get out.\u201dMark said,\n\u201cJames you stay with Sally and\nI will go get my dad.\u201d\nThen he dashed off into the darkness.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d James said.\n\u201cI am right here with you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Sally sobbed.\n\u201cYou\u2019re up there and I\u2019m down here.\u201d\nAs Sally turned in the darkness of the cave,\nshe bumped into something,\nscreamed, and began to cry.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d James yelled.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something down here with me,\u201d\nSally replied in a shaky voice.\nJust then, Mark and his dad came\nrunning through the woods.\nMark\u2019s father knelt down and asked Sally\nif she was okay. He could hear her crying and sobbing.\n\u201cSally, are you hurt?\u201d\nhe asked. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m scared and there is\nsomething down here with me.\u201d\n\u201cStand back Sally.\nI am lowering a rope and\nwill be down with you in a second.\u201dMark\u2019s dad tied the rope to the tree,\nfound the hole under the tree trunk,\nwiggled a bit, and lowered\nhimself into the cave.\nSally could see him coming down\nthe rope and stopped crying.\nNot only was he there but the cave became\nbrighter from the beam of\nhis flashlight as it danced\nacross the cave\u2019s floor and walls.As he reached the floor of the cave,\nhe shone the light on Sally and gave\nher a big hug. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI\u2019ll have you out of here in no time.\u201d\nThen he shone the light around\nand saw that she had fallen into a small cave.\nAnd very close to her,\nin the middle of the cave,\nwas something wrapped in layers\nof old blankets.\u201cMark, James, there\u2019s something down here.\nI am going to tie it to the rope and I want you to\npull it out.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d they replied.\nThe boys pulled out the object, untied it,\nand let the loose end of\nthe rope fall back into the cave.\nThe cave wasn\u2019t deep and Marks\u2019\ndad boosted Sally over his head so she could\ncrawl out. He then grabbed\nthe rope and with a little jump, was\nable to grab the opening\nand pull himself out.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to my house for a cup of hot tea.\nI\u2019ll call your parents so they aren\u2019t worried,\nand we\u2019ll see what treasure Sally found.\u201d He said.When they got to Mark\u2019s house,\nthey sipped their tea and began unwrapping the treasure.\nThey carefully peeled off layers of old blankets\nand cloth to reveal a wooden box.\nThey slowly opened it and stared in amazement.\u201cOh my,\u201d Sally said in disbelief.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe what I am seeing.\u201d\nThe boys and Mark\u2019s father just stared.\nInside the box were jewels of every color you could imagine.\nThere were diamonds,rubies, sapphires, and emeralds\nof all shapes and sizes.Intermixed they could see several\ngold coins and strands of pearls.\u201cWe\u2019re rich,\u201d the boys\nscreamed. \u201cNot quite,\u201d interrupted Mark\u2019s father. \u201cSomeone\ncould have lost this and I don\u2019t think you should plan on\nspending any of it until we find out a little more. Besides,\nSally found it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll share it,\u201d Sally said happily. \u201cThat\u2019s nice\nSally,\u201d replied Marks dad. But the right thing\nto do is contact the authorities.\u201dThe next day, the four of them\nand Sally\u2019s mother drove to the police station,\nexplained what had happened,\nand gave the treasure to the police to hold while\nthey conducted their investigation.\nThey left the police station sadly\nand even the double dipped ice cream cones\nMark\u2019s father bought for them\ndidn\u2019t make them smile.They drove back in silence.Several weeks passed with\nno word from the police.\nThen, one evening, Mark\u2019s father\ncalled James, Sally, and their parents.\n\u201cThe police just called and\nI think you should come over right now,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is some\nbad news about the treasure.\nThe police are on their way and\nwill explain everything when you get here.\u201dSally and James didn\u2019t say\nmuch during the ride to Mark\u2019s house.\nSally thought that since it was\n\u201cbad news\u201d the treasure belonged\nto someone else, even though\nthey probably lost it.\n\u201cWhatever happened to \u2018finders-keepers\u2019?\u201d\nshe mumbled. \u201cWhat did you say Sally?\u201d\nher mother asked. \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d\nSally replied. Then she let out\na long, sad sigh that echoed\nthrough the car.When they arrived at Mark\u2019s house,\nthe police were there with the treasure box.\nAs Sally entered,\nthe captain introduced himself and said,\n\u201cSally, this is yours.\nYour parents need to sign\nsome papers but the box and its\ncontents are yours.\u201dSally, Mark, and James\nshrieked with joy and danced\naround the room. Then Sally said,\n\u201cWhat is the bad news?\u201d\nThe captain smiled and said.\n\u201cThe treasure is worth more money than\nyou can imagine and with your\nnew found wealth comes\ngreat responsibility.\u201d Sally didn\u2019t quite understand\nwhat the captain was talking about and right now\nit really didn\u2019t matter.Mark asked,\n\u201cAre you going to share?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sally said.\n\u201cIf you and James didn\u2019t help me\nI might still be there.\u201d\nSeveral days later Sally asked\neveryone over to her house.\n\u201cI have decided what to do with\nthe money from the treasure after it is sold,\u201d\nshe said.\n\u201cI am giving 1/6 to our Mom and Dad,\n1/6 to Mark\u2019s Mom and Dad,\n1/6 to Mark, 1/6 to James, and 1/6 for me.\u201d\n\u201cThere is an extra 1/6,\u201d\nMark proudly stated. He loved math\nand was right on top of Sally\u2019s calculations.\u201cNo there\u2019s not,\u201d Sally said.\n\u201cIs too,\u201d James said. \u201cIs not,\u201d\nSally said in an angered voice. Just as\nMark was going to say,\n\u201cThey are at it again,\u201d Sally said,\n\u201cThis is why there isn\u2019t an extra 1/6!\nI am giving it to the local charity, so\nit can be given to those less\nfortunate and in need.\u201d\nHer mother and father said\nit was a caring and responsible thing to do.\nThey were very proud of her and knew that she\nunderstood what the captain meant when he had turned\nthe treasure over to her just days before.Advertisement\nYour Story Book!\nA book specially made, with you as the\nmain hero or heroine!\nPersonalised children\u2019s gifts by\nwww.monkeypen.comA simple game of hide-and-seek\nleads the children into the\nadventure of their lives.\nAn exciting story that will have\nlittle readers turning the pages,\neager to know what comes next.\nPlease share our books with your friends and\nfamily to support our mission.
